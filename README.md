# Book Exchange
Application developed with the means to have a group of people exchange books.

Users will be able to send invite to a book exchange, set a date to when it will take place, and update addresses in case they are to be mailed out. Lists of books that user has can be uploaded, and wishlist of books that user wants can also be created.

Groups and information remain private to maintain user security. User will be able to create a profile.

For future developments, user will be able to connect profile to Goodreads account. It will also have access to international language books.
